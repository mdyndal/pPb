We start with applying minimum transverse momentum requirement of 4~\GeV\ to both muons.
This requirement is imposed to ensure high lepton reconstruction and triggering efficiency in the ATLAS and CMS experiments during LHC's $p+\textrm{Pb}$ runs~\ref{}.
Moreover, due to limited acceptance of the detectors, each muon is required to have pseudorapidity ($\eta_{\ell}$) that satisfies $|\eta_{\ell}|<2.5$ condition.

Our calculations are carried out for a minimum dilepton invariant mass $m_{\ell\ell} = 10$~\GeV. 
Such a choice is due to removal of possible contamination from $\Upsilon(\rightarrow \ell\ell)$ photoproduction process.
