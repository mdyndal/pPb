\section{Fiducial selection and possible background sources}

We start with applying minimum transverse momentum requirement of 4~\GeV\ to both muons.
This requirement is imposed to ensure high lepton reconstruction and triggering efficiency in the ATLAS and CMS experiments during LHC's $p+\textrm{Pb}$ runs~\ref{}.
Moreover, due to limited acceptance of the detectors, each muon is required to have pseudorapidity ($\eta$) that satisfies $|\eta|<2.5$ condition.
