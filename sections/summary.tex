In summary, we propose a method that would unambiguously allow to test and constrain the photon parton distribution at LHC energies.
This method is based on the measurement of the cross-section for the reaction $p+\textrm{Pb}\rightarrow \textrm{Pb} + \ell^+\ell^- + X$, where the expected background is small comparing to the analogous process in $pp$ collisions. 
Results are shown for different choices of collinear photon PDFs, and a comparison is made with unintegrated photon distributions that include non-zero photon transverse momentum.
For collinear approach and  by analogy to DIS, the correct choice of the scale is identified.
Using simple (realistic) experimental requirements on lepton kinematics, it is shown that one can expect O(X) events with the existing datasets recorded by ATLAS/CMS at $\sqrt{s_{N N}} = 8.16$~\TeV\ for each lepton flavour.
