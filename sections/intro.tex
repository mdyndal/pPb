A significant fraction of proton-proton collisions at the LHC involves quasi-real photon interactions.

As the signal process does not involve the exchange of color with the photon-emitting nucleus, no significant particle production is expected in the rapidity region between the dilepton system and the nucleus. 
The photon-emitting nucleus is also expected to produce no neutrons because the photons couple to the entire nucleus. 
Thus a combination of a rapidity gap and zero neutrons in the same direction provide straightforward criteria to identify these events experimentally.
